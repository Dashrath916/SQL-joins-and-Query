# SQL Joins and Query Example

This repository provides examples of SQL joins and queries to retrieve data from multiple tables.

## Inner Join

An inner join combines rows from two tables based on a related column, returning only the rows with matching values.

## Left Join

A left join returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table, with NULLs for unmatched rows in the right table.

## Right Join

A right join returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table, with NULLs for unmatched rows in the left table.

## Full Outer Join

A full outer join returns all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows from both tables.

These examples demonstrate how SQL joins can be used to query data effectively.
